# Runtime composition

Use one provider-neutral core and compose it with replaceable boundaries.

```text
HEAD Core
  -> Project canon and authority
  -> AgentRuntimeAdapter
       -> Codex
       -> OpenCode
       -> future runtimes
  -> PlatformAdapter
       -> Windows
       -> macOS
       -> Linux
  -> WorkspaceHostAdapter
       -> native process
       -> optional Herdr
```

An AgentRuntimeAdapter should eventually expose capability probing, start, resume, event streaming, interrupt, and close through the runtime's supported machine interface. Do not scrape a TUI.

A PlatformAdapter should own paths, process trees, atomic file operations, permissions, IPC, service lifecycle, and executable discovery. Do not carry POSIX-only assumptions into Windows.

The current plugin implements project canon, instruction/config projection, and a read-only `RuntimeStateAdapter` for strict point-in-time host exports. That evidence adapter cannot probe or control a runtime. Process-hosting adapters remain deferred until they can prove caller identity, project binding, child ownership, cleanup, and runtime-session evidence.
