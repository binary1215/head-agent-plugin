# Review-gated Feature mapping

Read [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) and
[`authority-plane-contract.md`](authority-plane-contract.md) before changing
this authority boundary.

## Contract

Feature mapping protocol `0.2.0` connects authoritative `Feature` and `Capability` concepts to observed `File`, `Symbol`, and `Test` entities without allowing Core code analysis to invent either relevance or an approved product relationship.

The canonical directions are:

```text
File or Symbol -[:IMPLEMENTS]-> Feature or Capability
Feature or Capability -[:VERIFIED_BY]-> Test
```

A provider HEAD may propose mappings after reading current project evidence. Core then verifies the proposal schema, exact current endpoint identities and revisions, relationship direction, source and product snapshot bindings, bounded confidence, explanation, and content-addressed Evidence before creating an immutable `FeatureMappingCandidateSet`. Candidate and Evidence records have false instruction and promotion authority. With no semantic proposal, Core records an explicit Unknown and creates no candidates.

An explicit user-authored mapping `ReviewDecision` may accept all candidates, accept a named selection, or reject the batch. Acceptance does not mutate a candidate. It creates a separate `ReviewedRelationship` receipt linked to the candidate by `PROMOTED_FROM` and to the decision by `PRODUCES`, then materializes the reviewed canonical `IMPLEMENTS` or `VERIFIED_BY` edge. Rejection records `REJECTED_BY` and creates no canonical mapping edge.

Product Canon is not modified by mapping review. Every review requires the exact
current candidate set, verified digests, and no active or awaiting-review Run.
Acceptance additionally requires current repository and Product evidence matching
the proposal. An explicit user rejection may close that exact candidate set after
source or Product evidence changes; it cannot promote a relationship.

Rejection retains the immutable proposal and its historical bindings, while the
derived graph uses verified current Product identity. If World is verifiably
stale, the same explicit rejection operation refreshes it with preserved ancestry.
A missing World still needs explicit rebuilding; a corrupt World remains an
integrity error, not permission to overwrite it. After rejection, HEAD can inspect
current evidence and propose a replacement without source rollback or manual
state deletion. Drift or a request to start another proposal never invents a
user rejection, and prior reviewed relationship records remain intact.

If a decision was saved but its final workflow pointer was not, the same
normalized review request completes only that pointer after verifying the saved
decision and its World projection. This is recovery of an existing decision,
not another approval: later source drift is disclosed rather than grounds to
rewrite the decision or ask for reapproval. A different disposition, selection,
or rationale for that same candidate set fails before refresh or publication.
Multiple conflicting saved decisions also fail without selecting or deleting
one. Proposal and review writes share the existing Session mutation coordinator;
read-only status remains non-mutating and exposes a pending pointer completion.
Once completed, the unchanged request for the same current candidate returns the
verified existing result without changing stored project records. This does not reopen a reviewed batch
or allow replay against a newer candidate pointer.

Starting a proposal reuses the verified current World rather than rebuilding it
with empty ancestry. Derived mapping publication preserves the current source
and revision lineage. This prevents publication itself from making a current
proposal stale; actual source, Canon, or endpoint drift still requires fresh
evidence. Historical approval and the submitted proposal are not rewritten.

An explicit setup without a semantic proposal may build an absent World or
refresh a verified stale one within that same operation. It creates only the
existing evidence/Unknown batch, not inferred mappings or a user decision.
Read-only status never performs this setup.

## Commands

```text
node scripts/head.mjs feature-mapping-start <project> --input <semantic-mapping-proposal.json>
node scripts/head.mjs feature-mapping-status <project>
node scripts/head.mjs feature-mapping-candidates <project> --candidate-set <feature-mapping-candidates-id>
node scripts/head.mjs feature-mapping-review <project> --input <mapping-review.json>
node scripts/head.mjs feature-mapping-review-read <project> --review <feature-mapping-review-decision-id>
```

Example semantic proposal input:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "sourceSnapshotId": "source-snapshot-<24-hex>",
  "productModelId": "product-model-<24-hex>",
  "candidates": [
    {
      "relationshipType": "IMPLEMENTS",
      "sourceNodeId": "symbol-<24-hex>",
      "productNodeId": "feature-<24-hex>",
      "explanation": "The implementation behavior and the approved Feature contract match.",
      "confidence": 0.9
    }
  ]
}
```

Example acceptance input:

```json
{
  "candidateSetId": "feature-mapping-candidates-<24-hex>",
  "disposition": "accept-selection",
  "acceptedCandidateIds": ["feature-mapping-candidate-<24-hex>"],
  "rationale": "Reviewed repository and test evidence supports this product relationship."
}
```

`accept-all` ignores `acceptedCandidateIds`; `reject` accepts none. CLI review and typed MCP `head_feature_mapping_review` call the same Core mutation; MCP additionally requires `confirm_user_review: true`. MCP also exposes `head_feature_mapping_propose` and read-only `head_feature_mapping_status`. Normal temporal traversal excludes the unreviewed candidate surface unless `include_unreviewed_candidates` is explicitly enabled.

## Storage and projection

The local conformance path stores:

```text
.head/feature-mappings/current.json
.head/feature-mappings/candidate-sets/feature-mapping-candidates-*.json
.head/feature-mappings/review-decisions/feature-mapping-review-decision-*.json
```

Candidate sets and ReviewDecisions are immutable, digest-verified artifacts. `current.json` is only a digest-verified workflow pointer. The temporal graph and World Model remain rebuildable projections; Git and GraphDB are optional and do not participate in mapping authority.

If a previously reviewed endpoint disappears, the historical receipt remains with stale freshness and the current canonical edge is omitted. A later semantic proposal and explicit review are required to establish a new current mapping.

## Semantic proposal boundary

Core does not infer product meaning from names, paths, token overlap, or a repository-specific vocabulary. The provider HEAD owns semantic reading and proposes only bounded relationships; Core owns current-evidence verification, deterministic normalization, immutable storage, drift checks, and review gating. An invalid or stale proposal fails closed. There is no lexical fallback.

Provider-neutral live proposal orchestration, change-impact candidates, bulk user edits/revision batches, automatic mapping refresh, and general relationship-promotion policy remain deferred.
